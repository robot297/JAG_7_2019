    * A place object will need three private fields, with these names:
    *    name: A String for the place name (for example, Hawaii)
    *    reason: A String reason (a reason for visiting, for example, to go surfing)
    *    created: A Date created (when the Place object was created.
    *
    * Create get and set methods for all three fields. These will have names like
    * getName, setName, getReason, setReason, getCreated, setCreated.
    * Remember that IntelliJ can generate these methods for you.
    *
    * In this class, you'll need a *public* constructor that takes two arguments,
    * the name, and the reason.
    * The constructor can create and set the Date created.
    *
    * Place objects need to be sorted by name.
    * You'll need to make Place implement Comparable, so one Place can
    * be compared to another Place. This will allow a List of Place objects
    * to be sorted.
    *
    * Add the compareTo() method that Comparable requires.
    *
    *
    * Place objects need to be printed. Create a toString method
    * that returns a String with all of the information about this place.
    * For the example data above, the String should be this EXACT form:
    *
    * "Place to visit: Hawaii. Reason: to go surfing. Date created: Thu Oct 03 10:37:02 CDT 2019"
    *
    * If the place name is "Rome" and the reason is "to visit the Colosseum" then
    * the String should be in this EXACT form:
    *
    * "Place to visit: Rome. Reason: to visit the Colosseum. Date created: Thu Oct 03 10:42:19 CDT 2019"
    *
    * The Date information will be whatever date's toString method returns. You don't need to do any
    * date formatting.
